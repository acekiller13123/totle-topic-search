# TOTLE – Frontend Developer Internship (Round 1 Submission)

This repository contains my solution for Round 1 of the TOTLE Frontend Developer Internship.  
The task was to build a React component that displays a list of topics and filters them based on user input.  
I kept the functionality simple as required, but focused on delivering a clean, modern, and polished UI that feels smooth and intuitive.

- Handles empty input without issues  

### Interactive Topic Cards

- Easy-to-read layout  

### Modern UI
